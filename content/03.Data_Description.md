## Data Description

A brief statement providing background and purpose for collection of these data should be presented for readers without specialist knowledge in that area. A clear, concise, description of the data, the protocol(s) for data collection, data curation and quality control, as well as potential uses should then follow.

## Context

Please state what motivated you to produced this data, and give some background on the area of research to relate the work to previous studies and help understand its utility and potential for reuse.

## Methods

This section can potentially be further broken up into subheadings a) Sampling strategy and b) Steps. Related methods can also be grouped under corresponding subheadings. This section should provide enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat the study. In addition to including the design of the study, it needs to provide detail on the type of reagents, instrumentation and kits used (including any identifiers such as RRIDs).

Please include and cite the URLs (or DOIs if snapshots have been archived in a repository such as Zenodo or GigaDB) to any publically available bioinformatics tools that are used in the production of the data, including the exact version used. If you are using new bioinformatics tools that you have developed for production or processing of the data described here, this may be suitable for submission as a Technical Note. We strongly encourage the use of workflow management systems such as Galaxy and container systems such as Docker, to save the details of the methods to encourage reproducibility as well as conciseness. Our GigaDB repository can also be used to archive data, workflows and snapshots of the code with an accompanying DOI. We also offer integration with Code Ocean, a cloud-based computational reproducibility platform.

GigaScience encourages and assists with the submission of detailed protocols to the open access repository protocols.io. Please enter the details into protocols.io, issue a DOI, and cite the protocols.io record from the Methods section.

Authors benefit greatly by posting their methods in protocols.io as these are in a formatted form, allow inclusion of all the details, are fully searchable unlike supplementary files, and can be updated to new versions as basic methodology changes over time. Doing this saves authors extensive time in the future as the methods do not need to be rewritten in future manuscripts as they need only be cited.

For any article that presents software, in addition to making the source code available, we encourage submission to Code Ocean, a cloud-based computational reproducibility platform. Code Ocean supports any open-source programming language (as well as MATLAB and Stata). Authors should upload their code and data, specifying the appropriate languages and dependencies within the computational environment, to create a “compute capsule” that reproduces the results.

Once the code is published on Code Ocean, you will be issued DOI, which should be used to cite the compute capsule in the software section and any other relevant reference in the paper. Readers will then be able to view and verify the article’s results without needing to download or install anything. To submit, sign up to CodeOcean.

## Data Validation and quality control

Experiments supporting and demonstrating the technical quality of the dataset should be included in the manuscript. Data Notes can be published alongside traditional Research Articles, and any previous or in-press research using the data should be highlighted, as it will aid validation and demonstrate use.

## Re-use potential

Instructions and suggestions of downstream applications that may help other researchers with reuse of the data are also encouraged. This section can also promote discussion on possible ways the data presented might be used in or have a relationship with other areas of research that may not be directly apparent in the work.

Manuscripts that contain extensive biological analyses along with data production should be submitted as a Research Article.
