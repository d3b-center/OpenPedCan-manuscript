### QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

##### Focal Copy Number Calling (`focal-cn-file-preparation` analysis module)



##### Gene Set Variation Analysis (`gene-set-enrichment-analysis` analysis module)
Please refer to the OpenPBTA manuscript for details [@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100340].



##### Fusion prioritization (`fusion_filtering` analysis module)

The [`fusion_filtering`](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis/tree/dev/analyses/fusion_filtering) module filters artifacts and annotates fusion calls, with prioritization for oncogenic fusions, for the fusion calls from STAR-Fusion and Arriba.
After artifact filtering, fusions were prioritized and annotated as "putative oncogenic fusions" when at least one gene was a known kinase, oncogene, tumor suppressor, curated transcription factor, on the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census List, or observed in TCGA.
Fusions were retained in this module if they were called by both callers, recurrent or specific to a cancer group, or annotated as a putative oncogenic fusion.
Please refer to the module linked above for more detailed documentation and scripts.
