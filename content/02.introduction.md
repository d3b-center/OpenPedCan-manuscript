## Introduction

The Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) project at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is an open analysis effort in which we harmonize pediatric cancer data from multiple sources, perform downstream cancer analyses on these data, and provide them on PedcBioPortal and v2.1 of NCI's [Pediatric Molecular Targets Platform (MTP)](https://moleculartargets.ccdi.cancer.gov/).
The OpenPedCan analyses currently include the following datasets, described more fully below:

- OpenPBTA
- TARGET
- Kids First Neuroblastoma (X01)
- Kids First PBTA (X01)
- Chordoma Foundation
- MI-ONCOSEQ Study
- DGD (CHOP P30 Panel)
- GTEx
- TCGA
- CPTAC PBTA
- CPTAC GBM
- HOPE proteomics

**Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA)**
In September of 2018, the [Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN)](https://cbtn.org/) released the [Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (PBTA)](https://cbtn.org/pediatric-brain-tumor-atlas/), a genomic dataset (whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, proteomic, and clinical data) for nearly 1,000 tumors, available from the [Gabriella Miller Kids First Portal](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/).
In September of 2019, the Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA) Project was launched.
OpenPBTA was a global open science initiative to comprehensively define the molecular landscape of tumors of 943 patients from the CBTN and the PNOC003 DIPG clinical trial from the [Pediatric Pacific Neuro-oncology Consortium](http://www.pnoc.us/) through real-time, collaborative analyses and [collaborative manuscript writing](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-manuscript/) on GitHub, now published in [_Cell Genomics_](10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100340).
Additional PBTA data has been, and will be continually added to, OpenPedCan.

**Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments [(TARGET)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000218.v23.p8)**
The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) Initiative is an NCI-funded collection of disease-specific projects that seeks to identify the genomic changes of pediatric cancers. 
The overall goal is to collect genomic data to accelerate the development of more effective therapies.
OpenPedCan analyses include the seven diseases present in the TARGET dataset: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, Neuroblastoma, Osteosarcoma, Rhabdoid tumor, and Wilm’s Tumor.

**Gabriella Miller Kids First [(Neuroblastoma)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001436.v1.p1) and [PBTA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs002517.v2.p2)**
The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First) is a large-scale effort to accelerate research and gene discovery in pediatric cancers and structural birth defects.
The program includes whole genome sequencing (WGS) from patients with pediatric cancers and structural birth defects and their families.
OpenPedCan analyses include Neuroblastoma and PBTA data from the Kids First projects.

**Chordoma Foundation [@https://www.chordomafoundation.org/]**
The Chordoma Foundation seeks to advance research and improve healthcare for patients diagnosed with chordoma.

**MI-ONCOSEQ Study [@https://www.pathology.med.umich.edu/mctp/mi-oncoseq-study]**
These clinical sequencing data from the University of Michigan were donated to CBTN and added to the PBTA cohort.

**DGD [(CHOP P30 Panel)](https://www.chop.edu/cancer-panels)**
CHOP's [Division of Genome Diagnostics](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/division-genomic-diagnostics) has partnered with CCDI to add somatic panel sequencing data to OpenPedCan and the Molecular Targets Platform.

**The Genotype-Tissue Expression [(GTEx)](https://gtexportal.org/home/)**
GTEx project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public data resource and tissue bank to study tissue-specific gene expression, regulation and their relationship with genetic variants.
Samples were collected from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq.
OpenPedCan project includes 17,382 GTEx RNA-Seq samples from GTEx v8 release, which span across 31 GTEx groups in the v12 release.

**The Cancer Genome Atlas Program [(TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)**
TCGA is a landmark cancer genomics program that molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types.
It is a joint effort between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute.
OpenPedCan project includes 10,414 TCGA RNA-Seq samples (716 normal and 9698 tumor) from [33 cancer types]https://github.com/d3b-center/OpenPedCan-analysis/blob/dev/analyses/molecular-subtyping-integrate/results/tcga_cancer_groups.tsv).

**Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) PBTA proteomics study** 
The CPTAC pediatric pan-brain tumor study [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.044] contains 218 tumors profiled by proteogenomics and are included in OPC.

**CPTAC adult GBM proteomics study** 
This CPTAC adult GBM study [@doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2021.01.006] contains 99 tumors profiled by proteogenomics and are included in OPC.

**Project HOPE proteomics study**
Project HOPE is an adolescent and young adult high-grade glioma study (in preparation for publication) that contains 90 tumors profiled by proteogenomics and are included in OPC.

The OpenPedCan operates on a pull request model to accept contributions from community participants.
The maintainers have set up continuous integration software via GitHub Actions to confirm the reproducibility of analyses within the project’s Docker container.

The project maintainers include scientists from the [Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://d3b.center/).
We invite researchers to join OpenPedCan to help rigorously characterize the genomic landscape of these diseases to enable more rapid discovery of additional mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of pediatric brain and spinal cord tumors and overall accelerate clinical translation on behalf of patients.
